# expansionboardA

This repository contains plans for an expansion board built for QMTECH A7 200T core board.
It requires KiCAD 7 and required libraries (models/symbols) are included.


# Bill of materials

See expansionboardA.cv file for the list of components required for a fully populated board.

# TODO:
- Provide information about how to populate the board partially
- Provide information about 3v3 and 5v voltage path selection
