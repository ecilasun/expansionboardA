# Bill of materials

See expansionboardA.cv file for the list of components required for a fully populated board. Please note that some are optional (such as the USB controller chips) depending on your application.

# Default SoC, ROM image and samples

For hardware, visit https://github.com/ecilasun/tinysys. The project files require a recent version of Vivado suite to work.

For software, visit https://github.com/ecilasun/riscvtool and check the tinysys directory for the default ROM image and samples. The ROM image comes in two parts: the actual executable ROM and another one (fetch) that contains instruction sequences to inject on hardware/software interrupts. Samples demonstrate majority of the capabilities of the tinysys SoC itself.
